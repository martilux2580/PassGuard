    <value>In this panel the contents of the Vault you have logged in will be shown. This panel is composed of a table with eight columns (buttons) that show the saved data of each of your passwords, a search textbox along with three buttons to Reset and Search the content of the search textbox and to get Help of how this part of the program works, and five buttons at the bottom where you can Add, Edit, Delete, Export as PDF or Show Statistics of your PassGuard vault.

If you click in any of the column headers (except Password and Delete Row column headers), you can select to order your passwords by that column you´ve clicked in Normal Order (just as they were added), Ascending Order (from A-Z) or Descending Order (from Z-A). If you are ordering by Important Column alphabetically ascending or descending, the passwords marked as important will be ordered on top and in the order selected. Initially everything is ordered in Normal Order. The Vault cannot be ordered by two or more columns simultaneously. 

Rows composed of buttons with your password data will be shown in the table. In case of the password itself, a text composed of '***************' will be displayed. If any of those buttons is clicked, the whole text data will be copied to your clipboard (the actual password will be copied too). All data is stored in the buttons, but because of space issues it may not be shown completely, this could be the case of the Notes column.

The DeleteRow column makes it easy for the user to delete just that password. A pop-up confirmation window will be displayed before deleting the element. Deleted passwords cannot be recovered.

If you want to search for Names of passwords (column Name of the table) in your Vault, a Search Textbox for that is enabled just below the table contents. Both Reset and Search Button will enable only when there is data written in the textbox. This search functionality ignores the case and also the location where your search text appears in the name. As an example, if you search 'ne', names like Netflix or Benetton will pop up. The results of the search will be shown on the table, and operations over the search result (like editing or deleting) will affect the Vault´s content (for example, if you make a search and then delete all the contents, you will be deleting all the contents from your whole vault, not only all the results from the search result).

Five buttons at the bottom of the form will be displayed: 
	• Add: Adds a password to your Vault. Name, Username and Password cannot be blank, and the new Name cannot be already registered in your Vault. Be aware that textboxes support a limited number of characters, in case of the Notes column you should be OK if you save brief notes.
	• Edit: Edits a password from your Vault. In the drop-down list you can select the Name of the password you want to edit. Any field of the password can be modified, but the new Name cannot be already registered in your Vault (you can check all the registered names in the drop-down list).
	• Delete: Deletes a password from your Vault, or delete all the passwords from your Vault: In the drop-down list you can select the Name of the password you want to delete, then click on the button 'Delete Selected Element' and the data of that selected password will be deleted.
		o If the checkbox is Enabled, you can click in the button 'Delete All Elements' and all the elements of your Vault will be deleted.
		o Any deleted element cannot be recovered. Before deleting an element or all the elements, a pop-up window asking for confirmation of the action will be shown.
	• Export as PDF: Exports all the data from the current Vault into PDF format. This PDF will be stored in your My Documents folder in Windows OS. This action could take some minutes depending on the amount of data to export.
	• Show Statistics: Displays a new windows where you can select two types of statistics in the drop-down list, and after that you can click Generate to show them. Some statistics may take up to 2-3 minutes to show depending on the number of saved passwords and their characteristics. Clicking the Reset button will reset that window.
