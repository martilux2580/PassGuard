    <h1><b>PassGuard</b></h1>

To the point, **PassGuard is a modern-looking, fully offline and open source password manager** whose job is to securely store and provide to the user an active management of their passwords. **PassGuard executes correctly on 64-bit distributions of Windows 10**, however **both 32-bit and 64-bit distributions of .NET Framework 4.6 are required** for its operation.

## Why does PassGuard exist? PassGuard Origins
----------------------------------------------

<p>The idea of creating a password manager came firstly from the <b>desire to create a personal project</b> using the knowledge obtained in the first semesters of the Computer Engineering degree.<br> 
The first thing I did was to <b>look for (IT-related) processes in my life</b> that I could optimise. Among the first processes I thought of was the idea of creating a password manager. 
Within my close circle only one person uses a professional password manager, the rest of the people saved their passwords in a .txt file, wrote them by hand on a piece of paper or used the same password with small variations.<br>
In my case, <b>although the current password managers on the market have good reviews</b>, some have suffered security breaches (apparently without consequences for the users), and <b>the fact of saving all your valuable passwords in one place made me wary of these services</b>. That's why <b>I decided to create my own password manager :)</b><br>
I learned about the algorithms and security protocols that are used to store this data securely, and the result of this research and implementation is PassGuard.</p>

## Installation

<p>Right now <b>PassGuard is only available for 64-bit distributions of Windows 10</b> (gotta check Windows 11 though). <br>

For **basic users**, inside the PassGuard folder of this repository, there is a folder named WindowsInstaller64Bit, which contains a `.zip` file with all the required files and a `.exe` setup file. This `.exe` file will install PassGuard in your current Windows hard drive.<br>
